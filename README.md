## üé® Design

The goal is to provide a familiar, easy-to-use interface for exploring Geminispace. Gemtext documents are rendered without added clutter. Emojis are displayed in color and ZWJ emojis appear as a single image. üë®üèº‚ÄçüöÄ

Any system font can be used for displaying proportional text. Dozens of light and dark themes are available to make browsing easy on the eyes. The interface is simple and intuitive.

All settings, bookmarks, certificates and history are saved in an embedded database that can be backed-up and restored on other computers. Secure remote sync can be used to easily move your settings to other machines.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **Building from Source**
Alhena is built using **Maven** on Java 21 or greater. To compile, simply run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mochaman/alhena.git
cd alhena
mvn package
```

The `alhena.jar` will be created and copied to `target/lib`. To run, call java -jar with the path to /lib/alhena.jar. For example (if already in the target directory): 

```sh
java -jar ./lib/alhena.jar
```
## üìΩÔ∏è Inline Media With VLC

Alhena supports inline video and audio playback when VLC is installed. The feature must be enabled from the 'Settings' menu. The vlcj library does a good job of detecting VLC but there may be instances where you need to specify the location. This is done by creating a vlcj.config file in the ~/.config/vlcj directory. Examples:

On MacOS, discovery works fine if building from source. If you use one of the pre-build .dmg installs, you will likely need to create the vlcj.config file with the following line (assuming VLC is installed in the default location):
```sh
nativeDirectory=/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/lib
```
On versions of Linux using a snap install of VLC (like modern Ubuntu), you will likely need to create the vlcj.config file. The following is based on an Ubunutu snap install:
```sh
nativeDirectory=/snap/vlc/current/usr/lib
```
Whether the ~/.config/vlcj/vlcj.config file is required depends on whether discovery can find VLC. In testing, the embedded player worked "out of the box" on Windows, MacOS (built from source), Raspberry Pi and FreeBSD. VLC 3.x is required. Older versions will not work. VLC 4.x (in development) may or may not work.

Privacy Considerations: Per the author of vlcj, "it may be possible that a remote network access is made for meta data and album/cover art. This may unintentionally expose sensitive data regarding the media being parsed." If this is a concern, the embedded media player can be turned off from 'Settings'.
